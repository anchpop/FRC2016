How I got to my current spot:

1. I set up eclipse but I couldn't deploy to the RoboRIO, and I'm pretty sure it's because I need to image it with the latest version of all the software required. I tried to image it with the software on the old laptop but it wasn't detecting it for some reason, so I'm installing it on my laptop for further testing.
